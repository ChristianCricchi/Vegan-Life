            <h1>About Vegan Life</h1>
            <p>
                In our group of vegans, we are inspired by the definition of veganism according to Leslie Cross, founding member of the
                Vegan Society, who stated in 1951: "The word veganism means the doctrine that humans must live without exploiting
                animals." We firmly believe in this principle and work to spread our way of life based on ethics and respect for animals.
            </p>
            
            <P>
                As vegans, we refrain from consuming or using products such as meat, milk, eggs, fish, honey, wool, leather and any
                other animal derivatives in our daily lives. This commitment goes beyond a simple practice; It is a lifestyle that
                reflects our conviction to live without exploiting other forms of life on the planet.
            </P>
            <p>
                In early civilizations, dietary customs were based on plants. Pythagoras, considered the father of ethical
                vegetarianism, influenced numerous classical philosophers and writers. The ancient Greeks also observed that eating meat
                could be harmful to both health and mind.
