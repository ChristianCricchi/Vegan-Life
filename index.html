            <h1>About Vegan Life</h1>
            <p>
                The definition of veganism, as articulated by Leslie Cross, a founding member of the Vegan Society in 1951, assumes that
                veganism is a principle that goes beyond mere practice. The term “veganism” is defined as the doctrine that humans
                should live without exploiting animals. This definition implies a set of actions, decisions and relationships that give
                rise to a particular lifestyle. In daily practice, a vegan abstains from consuming or using products such as meat, milk,
                eggs, fish, honey, wool, leather and any other animal derivatives.
            
               In ancient civilizations, dietary customs were predominantly plant-based, with religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism
               recommending a vegetarian lifestyle. Early information on vegetarian nutrition dates back to the 6th century BCE, with
               Pythagoras considered the father of ethical vegetarianism. The "Pythagorean" lifestyle was adopted by numerous prominent
               philosophers and classical writers. Ancient Greeks also recognized the potential harm of consuming meat to both health
               and the mind.
            
               During the Renaissance, figures like Leonardo da Vinci adhered to a vegetarian diet, foreseeing a future where
               condemning the consumption of animals would be akin to condemning the consumption of fellow humans. Enlightenment-era
               thinkers like Tyron, Rousseau, Voltaire, and Wesley also followed vegetarian diets.
            
               However, veganism as a concept finds its origin in ethics. The term "vegan" was coined by Donald Watson in 1944,
               distinguishing it clearly from vegetarianism. While vegetarianism, in many cases, is seen as primarily a dietary choice
               motivated by health or ecological concerns, veganism extends beyond diet to become a lifestyle rooted in ethics.
            
               The comprehensive definition of veganism emphasizes its broader scope, encompassing all aspects of daily life, not just
               diet. This holistic approach contradicts the misconception that individuals define themselves as vegan solely based on
               dietary choices. Veganism, as coined by Watson, goes beyond a mere dietary preference, encompassing a comprehensive
               ethical lifestyle.

               Terms and Definitions:
            
                According to Barford (2014), various diets related to veganism can be defined as follows:
            
                Vegans:
            
                Do not consume dairy, eggs, or any other animal-derived products.
                Vegetarians:
            
                Do not consume meat, poultry, game, fish, seafood, or other sacrificed products.
                Lacto-ovo-vegetarians:
            
                Consume dairy products and eggs (the most common type of vegetarian diet).
                Lacto-vegetarians:
            
                Consume dairy but avoid eggs.
                Pescetarians:
            
                Consume fish and seafood but not meat.
                Reductores de carne (Meat Reducers):
            
                Reduce meat intake for ethical or environmental reasons.
                Semi/demi-vegetarians:
            
                Occasionally consume meat or poultry.
                Additionally, a term worth defining is cruelty-free: In the animal rights movement, "cruelty-free" qualifies products or
                activities that do not harm or kill animals. Products tested on animals are not considered cruelty-free due to the often
                painful tests that cause suffering to millions of animals each year (Andre, C. & Velásquez, M., n.d.).
