            <h1>About Vegan Life</h1>
            <p>
                In our group of vegans, we are inspired by the definition of veganism according to Leslie Cross, founding member of the
                Vegan Society, who stated in 1951: "The word veganism means the doctrine that humans must live without exploiting
                animals." We firmly believe in this principle and work to spread our way of life based on ethics and respect for animals.
            </p>
            
            <P>
                As vegans, we refrain from consuming or using products such as meat, milk, eggs, fish, honey, wool, leather and any
                other animal derivatives in our daily lives. This commitment goes beyond a simple practice; It is a lifestyle that
                reflects our conviction to live without exploiting other forms of life on the planet.
            </P>
            <p>
                In early civilizations, dietary customs were based on plants. Pythagoras, considered the father of ethical
                vegetarianism, influenced numerous classical philosophers and writers. The ancient Greeks also observed that eating meat
                could be harmful to both health and mind.

                        This section explores the motivations behind questioning the exploitation of animals for various purposes such as food, clothing, health, and vanity, focusing on what prompts individuals to adopt a vegan lifestyle or embrace cruelty-free culture.

                        <li>Learning Process towards Veganism: Individuals typically progress from being vegetarian to becoming vegan.
                            The process is rooted in individuals' personal meanings and how they fit into the world.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Childhood Influences: Motivations for veganism can trace back to childhood experiences, the conflicting message of loving some animals while consuming others often leads to a latent period, where individuals, 
                            unable to make decisions during childhood, revisit these impressions later in life, potentially becoming vegetarians or vegans.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Empathy and Ethical Considerations: The Empathy and ethicl,  plays a crucial role for individuals to adopt a plant-based diet.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>These motivations often have their roots in childhood experiences and ethical reflections on the treatment of animals.</li>

                            The principles of veganism, presented by Donald Watson, were published during the 11th Congress of the International 
                            Vegetarian Union in the journal "The Vegan" by the Vegan Society in 1947.
