## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the vegan life site is very important to the overall experience of the user. A calm theme is consistently used across all imagery with lots of green and peacefull scenes. This gives the sense of union with nature and animals which has great benefits for health, mental health and is intended to invoke a sense of calm and non-violence in the user. The colour green and nature and anumals theme is also important as this ties into the main colour scheme of the website.

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is white and green with varying shades of green orange used to tie in with the vegan imagery. A dark grey font is used which has a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read. 

### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I am using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font is not being imported into the site correctly.

### Form Testing

### Links Testing

- Social Media links in the footer of each page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page and open in a new tab. 

### Browser Testing
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.
    
### Device Testing
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, iPhoneX and iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.
- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
    - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=christiancricchi.github.io%2FVegan-Life%2F)
    - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://christiancricchi.github.io/Vegan-Life/)


### Friends and Family User Testing
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs

#### Anchor link scroll with a fixed position header
- The header element contains anchor links to allow the user to navigate to different sections within the website. By default, these will scroll so that the target element is flush with the top of the browser window.
- When I updated the header to use a fixed top position, the beginning of each section ended up being covered by the header, which wasnâ€™t ideal.
- To resolve this I created div elements at the top of each section and applied a relative position with a -75px top position (the same height as the header). This way, when the user clicks on a nav link, the browser window scrolls to the top of the corresponding section.

### Known Bugs

- HTML Smooth Scroll does not work on Safari browser.
- When the screen size is reduced, the 4 circular images overlap instead of being in a column.
