## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the vegan life site is very important to the overall experience of the user. A calm theme is consistently used across all imagery with lots of green and peacefull scenes. This gives the sense of union with nature and animals which has great benefits for health, mental health and is intended to invoke a sense of calm and non-violence in the user. The colour green and nature and anumals theme is also important as this ties into the main colour scheme of the website.

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is white and green with varying shades of green orange used to tie in with the vegan imagery. A dark grey font is used which has a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read. 

### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I am using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font is not being imported into the site correctly.
